First Miner in Hex Priority
===========================

  

This proposal seeks to protect and reward the first miner who is installed in a hex.

At this moment, a new miner installed in an empty hex can obtain NFTs after 30 days with 98%RRR. However, if a new miner appears during this period with an associated NFT, the first miner in the hex will no longer have a chance of obtaining an NFT, even if the last miner to appear has a very low RRR percentage.

If for the growth and better coverage of the GEONET network it is important to install new miners in empty HEX's, I think these new miners should at least have the possibility of obtaining NFTs.

  

I may not propose the best solution for this protection and reward. But so my proposal is:

\-Automatic NFT allocation and respective protection to the first empty HEX miner;

\-If at the end of 35 days this miner does not reach 98%RRR, he loses NFT protection, and the existing NFT protection rules begin to be applied.

  

Best Regards
