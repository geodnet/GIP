GIP3: Crosschain (Solana / IoTex) GEOD Airdrop to Incentivize the Adoption of GEODNET Mobile App and Mobile Location SDK
========================================================================================================================

Author: GEODNET foundation

Category: GEOD Token & New Product  

  

**Summary**

The GEODNET Foundation is developing a Mobile App (GEODNET Quest App) and a GEODNET Mobile Location SDK. Starting with Android support, these mobile products will provide numerous contributions to the GEODNET community: providing proof of RTK coverage, supporting mapping protocols, mobile proof of location protocols, enhancing community engagement, and promoting crosschain GEOD support.  

The GEODNET Foundation seeks to incentivize adoption of its Mobile Apps and Mobile SDK with limited-scope user-action airdrop rewards. These airdrops will be specifically aligned to GEODNET Foundation’s goals in terms of data validation, community growth, and early user testing of critical features.

  

**Key Points of Proposal:**  

1.  Create a crosschain Solana version of GEOD:

*   Enable a Wormhole between Polygon-based GEOD and Solana-based GEOD.
*   Allocate up to 10M Solana-based GEOD tokens for airdrops (1% of total supply, 10% of ecosystem pool).
*   The Solana-based GEOD airdrop will be exclusively distributed through the GEODNET family of APPs. The first APP will be GEODNET Quest, and then a 2nd app is planned specifically for launch on the Solana Saga Phone and Solana Chapter 2 Phone.

2\. IoTeX ongoing collaboration:

*   IoTeX’s ioPay app will become the first user and tester of the GEODNET mobile SDK.
*   Allocate up to 1M GEOD ecosystem tokens for IoTeX’s ioPay app users completing specific actions that validate GEODNET’s Mobile SDK and Positioning Engine.

  

**Motivation**

Benefits to the adoption of GEODNET Mobile Apps and Mobile SDK

1.  Proof of RTK Coverage – Users using the GEODNET Quest app will be able to perform hex level RTK performance validation under real-world conditions.
2.  Support Mapping Protocols – the GEODNET Mobile App and mobile SDK can allow other protocols, especially mapping and mobility related protocols, to take advantage of location accuracy and precision far superior to of that provided by Android or iOS.
3.  Support Mobile Location Verification Protocols – GEODNET through its Mobile App and Mobile SDK can cryptographically validate an asserted location and provide proof on the blockchain.
4.  Community Expansion– today participation in GEODNET has been limited to Satellite Mining which requires access to rooftop real-estate. This naturally limits the size of the GEODNET community. However, mobile app-based interactions with GEODNET and GEOD will be limitless including - walking, driving, biking, swimming, surfing, gaming and so much more. This has potential to greatly expand the size of GEODNET’s web3 community.
5.  Crosschain Support – crosschain support of GEOD token can help drive new use cases, composability, ease of use, and new community. Mobile app products will utilize crosschain technologies from inception. Solana is an obviously important protocol within the DePIN community that GEODNET currently does not support.

**Expected Outcome:**  

*   Successful launch of the GEODNET Quest App and Mobile Location SDK
*   Wide adoption of GEODNET Mobile APPs and Mobile Location SDK
*   Increased community size and engagement
*   Expanded use cases through crosschain support

**Stakeholders:**

Affected Parties include GEODNET RTK network users, GEOD miners, GEOD token holders, GEODNET team and Foundation, and the broader DePIN community.

  

**Deployment Plan:**  

The mobile app and SDK will be introduced in Q3 2024.  

  

**Impact on current ecosystem stakeholders:**

Potential pros:  

*   Increased GEODNET usage
*   Increased GEOD token holders

Potential cons:  

*   Crosshchain support may confuse some users and introduce new angles for users to get scammed.
*   Adoption of the Solana-based GEOD might occur faster than expected which could pose challenges to our CEX listings.

  

**Rationale and Alternatives**

Other incentives considered: We have considered MEME coins such as BONK and dogwifhat (WIF) for airdrops while still requiring engagement with the GEODNET work for RTK services.

  

**Success Metrics**

*   Number of mobile app downloads and active users.
*   Amount of validated RTK coverage data collected via mobile app.
*   Increase in GEODNET community participation.
*   Successful integration and use of crosschain functionalities.
