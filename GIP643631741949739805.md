GIP6: Performance-Based Reward & Penalty System
===============================================

• Author: GEODNET Foundation  

• Category: Network Reward Rules  

  

**Summary**

This proposal introduces a new performance-based rewards system for GEODNET stations to improve service quality, incentivize high-performing backbone stations, and reduce overall network downtime and signal multipath.  

*   Only backbone stations selected by the GEODNET Foundation are eligible for bonus rewards. Backbone stations are more valuable because of their location and performance.
*   Introduce penalties for all underperforming stations, with rewards reallocated to fund an extra rewards pool for high-performing backbone stations.
*   Phase out dual-band stations, with discounted upgrades available until the implementation of GIP6.
*   All miners will be required to provide two updated contact details (Email and Mobile Number).

**Motivation**

The core goal of this proposal is to enhance the overall service quality of the GEODNET network, focusing on improving station performance, minimizing downtime and reducing signal multipath to deliver high-quality data service for customers. As GEODNET expands, it is essential to ensure that RTK users experience reliable, high-quality positioning services. This proposal ensures that underperforming stations are incentivized to improve, while high-performing stations are rewarded, resulting in a more efficient and effective network.

By implementing performance-based rewards and penalties, it aligns network interests with customer needs, benefiting both miners and end-users.

  

**Stakeholders**

*   GEODNET Miners: Responsible for maintaining GEODNET stations and ensuring high performance.
*   GEODNET Network Users/Customers: End-users benefiting from consistently precise and reliable positioning services.

  

**Detailed Explanation**

**Penalty System:**

*   Underperforming stations will face penalties in the form of the removal of rewards. These penalties will fund the "extra bonus" for high-performing backbone stations.
*   All stations with two-hourly RRR < 80% will lose rewards for that two-hour, both for NFT and non-NFT stations.
*   Stations with two-hourly MP1 or MP2 > 0.75 will lose rewards for that two-hour. This data metric will be provided by the GEODNET RTK team.
*   Phase out dual band stations upon the implementation of GIP6.

**Rewards System:**

*   Only backbone stations selected by the GEODNET Foundation are eligible for bonus rewards.
*   USA backbone stations with 30-day RRR ≥ 99% are eligible for bonus rewards.
*   Backbone stations in the EU and the rest of the world with 30-day RRR ≥ 99.99% are eligible for bonus rewards.
*   Only the eligible station with the best RRR per hex will receive the extra rewards for that hex. If two eligible stations have an RRR tie, both stations get bonus rewards.
*   Eligible stations will share the extra rewards pool evenly. Rewards are calculated and distributed weekly.

  

**Drawbacks**

*   External Factors: Miners may be penalized for issues beyond their control.
*   Complexity: Tracking performance and managing rewards could increase operational complexity.
*   Impact on New Miners: New miners may struggle to meet performance thresholds initially.

  

**Alternatives Considered**

1.  Flat Reward System: We could maintain a simple flat reward system for all stations, but this would fail to address the disparity in performance between high-performing and underperforming stations.
2.  No Penalty System: Eliminating the penalty system could lead to less incentive for miners to improve station performance, resulting in more downtime and unreliable services for customers.

**Deployment Impact**

*   Technical: A robust system to track and measure RRR and performance will be required.
*   Economic: Improved performance could boost miner motivation and attract more customers.

  

**Success Metrics**

*   Improved Station Performance: More stations reaching 99.9% RRR and reduced underperformance.
*   Reduced Downtime: Decrease in downtime for critical stations.
*   Customer Satisfaction: Positive feedback and increased customer base.
*   Miner Participation: Growth in active miners and improved performance consistency.
