GIP-8: Network Scaling & NFT Supply Cap
=======================================

GIP-8: Network Scaling & NFT Supply Cap

  

Summary

GIP-8 introduces changes to the rules for acquiring, retaining, and limiting Location NFTs to protect their value, ensure high network performance, and prevent oversaturation.

This proposal includes:

*   A hard cap of 20,000 active Location NFTs across the entire network
*   One NFT-holding station per Hex (earliest or highest-performing station wins)
*   New performance rules for earning and keeping NFTs (≥98% RRR to earn, ≥80% RRR to keep)
*   These rules aim to incentivize high-quality station deployments, prevent low-performing stations from blocking better ones, and control overall network growth.

Motivation

*   Encourage high-quality stations: Stations must provide strong, consistent data to earn and retain NFTs.
*   Stop low performers from blocking rewards: Currently, poorly performing stations can hold NFTs and prevent better stations from earning them.
*   Control network size: The original 100,000 station goal is excessive for effective coverage. A 20,000 NFT cap ensures a sustainable and valuable network.
*   Increase predictability: Clear supply limits create a healthier reward system and better token value alignment.

  

Detailed Explanation

1\. NFT Acquisition Rules

*   To earn or re-activate an NFT, a station must achieve a ≥98% 30-day RRR.
*   If two or more stations in the same Hex meet the requirement on the same day:

*   NFT goes to the station with the highest 30-day RRR.
*   If tied, NFT goes to the station with the earliest install timestamp in that Hex.

2\. NFT Retention Rules

*   Active NFT holders must maintain a ≥80% 60-day RRR.
*   Dropping below this threshold makes the NFT inactive.
*   If multiple eligible stations are competing for an inactive NFT, the award process follows the acquisition rules above (highest RRR, then earliest install timestamp).

3\. 20,000 Active NFT Cap

*   The number of active NFTs across the network is capped at 20,000.
*   If the cap is reached, no new NFTs can be awarded, and inactive NFTs cannot be reactivated until a spot opens.
*   When a spot opens:

*   All stations with ≥98% 30-day RRR in eligible Hexes are considered.
*   The NFT goes to the station with the oldest install timestamp in that Hex.

  

Pros

*   Increases scarcity and long-term value of NFTs
*   Rewards reliable and strategically placed stations
*   Prevents overcrowding in already-covered Hexes
*   Eliminates the “bad station blocking good station” problem
*   Keeps network quality high for end users

  

Cons

*   New miners in claimed Hexes may be discouraged if the cap is reached
*   Could limit redundancy in high-value areas without mobile coverage expansion
*   Cap may need to be readdressed in the future if network requirements change

Success Metrics

*   Time taken to reach the 20,000 NFT cap
*   Percentage of NFT holders maintaining ≥80% RRR
*   Geographic spread of NFT-holding stations
*   Reduction in low-performing stations holding NFTs
*   Community feedback on fairness and onboarding process

  

Deployment Impact

*   Uses existing metrics already tracked in the GEODNET system, minimizing technical complexity.
*   First performance checks will occur 30 days after implementation.
*   Simple to adjust in future governance votes if network coverage needs change.
