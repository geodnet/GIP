GIP-7: Solana Migration & Token Transfer Incentives

  

Summary

GIP-7 proposes to accelerate GEODNET’s transition to the Solana network by:

*   Introducing a 30-day incentive program to encourage holders to migrate GEOD from Polygon to Solana
*   Setting an end date for Polygon support in March 2027

These actions aim to increase token liquidity on Solana, simplify user onboarding, and position Solana as GEODNET’s primary Web3 ecosystem.

  

Motivation

GEODNET has grown into the largest decentralized RTK network, but its Web3 presence remains limited. Solana offers lower fees, fast execution, mobile integration, and a vibrant DePIN ecosystem. This proposal builds on momentum seen during high Solana activity in early 2025, which coincided with GEODNET’s highest TVL and token price.

  

Detailed Explanation

Incentivize Migration:

*   Allocate up to 4 million GEOD (0.4% of total supply) to reward early migration from Polygon to Solana during a 30-day period.

Phase Out Polygon:

*   Full deprecation of Polygon support targeted for March 2027.

  

Pros

*   Simplifies user experience and onboarding
*   Focuses liquidity in one network (Solana)
*   Easier to implement on-chain payments
*   Aligns with Solana’s position as a DePIN hub

  

Cons

*   May confuse users without clear messaging
*   ERC and SPL are both strong standards; removing one reduces flexibility
*   Future Layer 2 deployment options may require re-evaluation

  

Success Metrics

*   Total volume of GEOD migrated from Polygon to Solana
*   Growth in Solana-based holders and liquidity
*   Community participation in the migration incentive program
*   Reduced Polygon-based activity over time
