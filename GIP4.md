GIP-4: Incentivizing the Adoption of GEODNET Mobile Apps and SDK
================================================================

Author: The GEODNET Foundation

Category: New Products & Promotion  

**Summary:**

The GEODNET Foundation is developing a Mobile App (GEODNET Quest App) and a GEODNET Mobile Location SDK. Starting with Android support, these mobile products will provide numerous contributions to the GEODNET community: providing a better user experience for car navigation, providing proof of RTK coverage, supporting mapping protocols, mobile proof of location protocols, enhancing community engagement.    

The GEODNET Foundation seeks to incentivize adoption of its Mobile Apps and Mobile SDK with limited-scope user-action token rewards. These incentivizing rewards will be specifically aligned to GEODNET Foundation’s goals in terms of data validation, community growth, and early user testing of critical features.

  

**Key Points of Proposal:**    

1.  Allocate 1M tokens for initial RTK connectivity and DEMO accounts. 100 GEOD / Account, approximately 14 – 30 days.
2.  Allocate 2M tokens for Proof of Coverage rewards i.e., verifying RTK Fix in Hexes while driving.
3.  Allocate 2M tokens for Rewards to Solana SAGA dApp.
4.  Allocate 1M tokens for rewards to first SDK integration (ioPay is planned).  Rewards based on checkins.
5.  Allocate 1M token as a reserve.  

  

**Motivation**  

Benefits to the adoption of GEODNET Mobile Apps and Mobile SDK  

*   Proof of RTK Coverage – Users using the GEODNET Quest app will be able to perform hex level RTK performance validation under real-world conditions.
*   Support Mapping Protocols – the GEODNET Mobile App and mobile SDK can allow other protocols, especially mapping and mobility related protocols, to take advantage of location accuracy and precision far superior to of that provided by Android or iOS.
*   Support Mobile Location Verification Protocols – GEODNET through its Mobile App and Mobile SDK can cryptographically validate an asserted location and provide proof on the blockchain.
*   Community Expansion– today participation in GEODNET has been limited to Satellite Mining which requires access to rooftop real-estate. This naturally limits the size of the GEODNET community. However, mobile app-based interactions with GEODNET and GEOD will be limitless including - walking, driving, biking, swimming, surfing, gaming and so much more. This has the potential to greatly expand the size of GEODNET’s web3 community.

  

**Expected Outcome:**  

Successful launch of the GEODNET Quest App and Mobile Location SDK Wide adoption of GEODNET Mobile APPs and Mobile Location SDK Increased community size and engagement
 
 **Vote Result: Pass**
