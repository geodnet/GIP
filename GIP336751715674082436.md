GIP-1: Implementing the GEODNET Governance Platform for Community Management
============================================================================

**Author: The GEODNET foundation members**

**Category: Governance  
**

**Summary**

This proposal seeks to implement the GEODNET Governance Platform to manage community decisions more effectively. By adopting the governance platform, we can ensure that all voices within the GEODNET community are heard and considered in the decision-making process. This proposal outlines the plan to implement the GEODNET Governance Platform, aiming to foster a more engaged, transparent, and democratic community management process.

  

**Motivation**

*   To enhance community engagement and ensure that all key stakeholders have a voice in the governance of the GEODNET project.
*   The platform supports proposal submission, voting on community initiatives, and ensuring transparent decision-making processes.
*   It addresses the need for a structured, transparent and democratic governance process.
*   Expected outcomes include increased community participation, improved transparency, and more informed and democratic decision-making.

  

**Stakeholders**

*   Key stakeholders include GEOD miners, GEOD token holders, and the GEODNET foundation members.
*   Feedback will be gathered through the GEODNET Discord channels, social media platforms, and direct communications with key stakeholders.

  

**Detailed Explanation**

The GEODNET Governance Platform will be officially used as the GEODNET project’s governance tool once this proposal is passed by majority votes. Key processes and features of the GEODNET Governance Platform include:

1.  Connecting MetaMask:  
    Users will need to connect their MetaMask wallet to the platform to participate in governance activities. Detailed, step-by-step instructions will be provided to ensure a seamless onboarding process. Tutorials and guides will be made available.
2.  Reviewing Rules:  
    Participation in governance activities requires users to hold a Location NFT, have staked GEOD tokens in a SuperHex, or hold locked GEOD tokens.
3.  Submitting Proposals:  
    Users can submit governance proposals through their account on the platform. Each proposal will undergo an audit process to ensure it meets the necessary criteria before being published for community voting.
4.  Voting:  
    Eligible members can vote on proposals. Voting power is determined by the user's veNFT, which is determined by user’s Location NFTs, Staked GEOD tokens, or Locked GEOD tokens. Voting periods will be clearly communicated.
5.  Real-time Updates:  
    The platform will provide real-time updates on voting power and the status of proposals, ensuring transparency throughout the governance process.

  

Representative Example:

A miner proposes a new feature to optimize GEODNET's mining efficiency. They submit the proposal via the platform, which undergoes an audit and is then approved for community voting. Eligible members can vote, and if the proposal receives the required majority votes, it will be implemented. The entire process, from submission to implementation, is transparent and documented.

**Drawbacks**

*   Potential issues with participation: Not all members may actively participate, leading to decisions being made by a smaller, less representative group. To mitigate this, proposers can promote their proposals in our dedicated Discord channel.
*   Complexity for new users: The requirement to use MetaMask and understand veNFT voting might be a barrier for some users. To mitigate this, we will provide comprehensive on-boarding support, including Gitbook manuals and Discord QAs.

  

**Rationale and Alternatives**

*   This proposal leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparent, verifiable, and decentralized governance.
*   Discord community suggestions have been considered but this form of decision-making lacks transparency, structure, and democracy.
*   Without this governance platform, GEODNET risks lower community engagement and less democratic and informed decision-making, potentially stifling innovation and growth.

**  
Deployment Impact**

*   Deployment process: The platform will be rolled out once the proposal is passed with majority votes. Feedback from community members will be used to make necessary improvements before full deployment.
*   Impact on current users: Users will need to familiarize themselves with the new platform and processes. Comprehensive documentations and support will be provided to ease this transition.
*   Documentation updates: The GEODNET Gitbook and other resources will be updated to include comprehensive guides on using the governance platform. Regular updates will be provided to keep the community informed.
*   Backwards compatibility: The platform will be designed to integrate with the existing GEODNET systems. If the GIP needs to be undone, a rollback procedure will be established to ensure minimal disruption.

  

**Success Metrics**

*   Performance Increase: Measure the efficiency of decision-making processes.
*   Improvement in Stability: Track the stability of the governance platform.
*   Reduction in Complexity: Assess user feedback on the ease of use of the platform.
*   User Acceptance: Monitor participation rates and feedback from community members to gauge acceptance and satisfaction.
*   Engagement Metrics: Track the number of proposals submitted, voting participation rates, and the diversity of participants to ensure broad representation.
 
 **Vote Result: Pass**
