GIP5: SuperHex Bonus Rewards Requirement
========================================

**Summary:**
------------

This proposal closes the "SH Sniping" loophole, while also rewarding stations providing useful data to the network within SuperHexes.

**Motivation:**
---------------

Currently there is an issue with non-performant stations being rewarded SuperHex bonuses without providing useful data to the network while blocking useful stations from claiming the bonus. Quality requirements were in the original SH rules, but never enforced. A minimum level of data quality (RRR) over a 7-day period will be required to claim a SH open spot, and a minimum quality level to retain the SH spot.

These requirements will benefit the network by incentivizing station that are providing useful data to the network, while also closing the "SH Sniping" loophole that currently exists.

This change would only apply to Phase 2 (and beyond) SuperHexes.

**Detailed Explanation:**
-------------------------

This proposal would make the following changed to the rules governing the SuperHex bonus reward system:

### **1\. Receiving the SH reward Open Spot:**

The first station by timestamp (no ties) that reaches a 7-day RRR of ≥95% will take the open SuperHex spot and thus the bonus multiplier for that Superhex. If the RRR is only applied once per day and two stations hit ≥95% at the same time, the station with the earlier install time will be awarded the open SuperHex Spot.

### **2\.  Retaining the SH reward Open Spot:**

A station that currently has the SuperHex Spot, if that station has a 14-day RRR\* lower than 84%, they will lose the SuperHex Spot. This check will first occur 14 days after the station receives the SuperHex Spot.  
The 14 day window will start upon the the implementation date of this GIP. (eg. The 14 day RRR will not count the station's RRR data before implementation)

The next station in the SuperHex with a 7-day RRR\* of ≥95% will then be awarded the SuperHex Spot. If there are multiple stations that qualify, the station with the highest 7-day RRR\* in the SuperHex will be awarded the Spot. In the event of a RRR\* tie, timestamp of the install in the SuperHex will be used.

_\*All RRR tracking is only the RRR accrued while the station is installed in the SuperHex. As per GIP 2, RRR numbers are reset to 0% upon a move between Hexes._

**Deployment Impact**
---------------------

1\. The staking success benchmark will be updated from “a station installed” to “a station with ≥ 90% RRR over 7 days installed.”
