GIP6 - Restricting SuperHex Installations to New Miners
=======================================================

**Summary**  

According to the GEODNET Foundation, a SuperHex is a designated area where GEODNET customers require base stations, but there is currently no miner coverage. SuperHexes are created to encourage the deployment of base stations by offering higher incentives. I propose that only new miners—i.e., newly deployed base stations—be eligible to install in SuperHexes.

  

**Motivation**

*   Fairness for new miners: Delivery of new equipment often involves long waiting times. Existing miners have an unfair advantage, as they can quickly relocate to SuperHexes and claim bonus rewards.
*   Network stability for GEODNET customers: Frequent relocation of base stations to hunt for SuperHex incentives disrupts network usage, negatively impacting GEODNET’s reputation. Ensuring network stability is critical for retaining and attracting high-profile customers, such as Tesla.

  

**Drawbacks**

There are no significant drawbacks. This proposal prevents existing miners or those operating multiple stations from relocating and disrupting network stability.

  

**Success Metrics**

*   Continuous growth in the number of miners.
*   High customer satisfaction, resulting from stable network performance.
